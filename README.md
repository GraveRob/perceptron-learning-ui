# perceptron-learning-ui
Here's simple interface of my perceptron. It can easily help you to understand the basis of a Neural network using uncomplicated methods.

After opening this program you can see **3 containers**. 

**The first one** is used to choose the number. 
Afterwards, this number will be used to teach your perceptron recognize her in the **second container**. 
**The last one** is also used to make sure that you are a good teacher ! Just draw in the third container number (or something that can be recognized like a number) and see how easily your perceptron can understand it.

It's also possible to see **_statistics_** of your perceptron learning in the second container (press "History").
This process shown there step by step.

**_Green_** field means that percptron is sure that this field is **_important_** (lighter = more important).
**_Red_** field, respectively, means that field must be **_unactive_**.
